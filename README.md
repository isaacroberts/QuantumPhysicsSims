### Quantum Physics Simulations

Some Numpy simulations that I wrote to help myself visually understand quantum mechanics. These simulations use the Schrodinger equation, meaning they only apply to bosons (Photons, W, Z, and Higgs).

This code shows off the 1, 2, and 3 dimensional cases for single particles in orbital wells, free particles, and particle-in-a-box.

Big thanks to [pySchrodinger](https://github.com/jakevdp/pySchrodinger "pySchrodinger") and [Philip Mocz's Medium Article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-your-own-quantum-mechanics-simulation-with-python-51e215346798?gi=9b16411cffee  "Philip Mocz"), who provided the initial code for this project. 

These simulations use the Fourier Transform to solve the Schrodinger Equation. For a better explanation of the math, read the blog posts linked above.
