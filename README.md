### Quantum Physics Simulations

These are some quantum physics simulations written in Numpy, based on code from [pySchrodinger](https://github.com/jakevdp/pySchrodinger "pySchrodinger") and [Philip Mocz's Medium Article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-your-own-quantum-mechanics-simulation-with-python-51e215346798?gi=9b16411cffee  "Philip Mocz")

These simulations use the Fourier Transform to approximate the Schrodinger Equation. For a better explanation of the math, read the blog posts linked above. 

This code shows off the 1, 2, and 3 dimensional cases for single particles in orbital wells, free particles, and particle-in-a-box.
